# Data Input and Exploration

## Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

We will explore a subset of data collected by the CDC through its
extensive Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ([BRFSS][])
telephone survey. Check out the link for more information. We'll look
at a subset of the data.

First, we need to get the data. Either download the data
from [THIS LINK](BRFSS-subset.csv) or have R do it directly from the
command-line (preferred):

```{r}
download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seandavi/ITR/master/BRFSS-subset.csv',
              destfile = 'BRFSS-subset.csv')

```

You can check to see the file using the Rstudio file panel or get a
directory listing using `dir()`

1. Use `file.choose()` to find the path to the file 'BRFSS-subset.csv'

    ```{r file.choose-A2, eval=FALSE}
    path <- file.choose()
    ```

<!--
    ```{r file.path, echo=FALSE}
    path <- "BRFSS-subset.csv"
    ```
-->

2. Read the data into R using `read.csv()`, assigning to a variable `brfss`.

    ```{r read.csv-A2}
    brfss <- read.csv(path)
    ```
    

3. Use command like `class()`, `head()`, `dim()`, `summary()` to explore
the data.

    - What variables have been measured?

    - Can you guess at the units used for, e.g., Weight and Height?
    
    ```
    class(brfss)
    head(brfss)
    dim(brfss)
    summary(brfss)
    ```

4. Use the `$` operator to extract the 'Sex' column, and summarize the
   number of males and females in the survey using `table()`. Do the
   same for 'Year', and for both `Sex` and `Year`

    ```{r brfss-sex-A2}
    table(brfss$Sex)
    table(brfss$Year)
    table(brfss$Sex, brfss$Year)
    with(brfss, table(Sex, Year))                # same, but easier
    ```

5. Use `aggregate()` to summarize the mean weight of each group. What
   about the median weight of each group? What about the _number_ of
   observations in each group?

    ```{r brfss-aggregate}
    with(brfss, aggregate(Weight, list(Year, Sex), mean, na.rm=TRUE))
    with(brfss, aggregate(Weight, list(Year=Year, Sex=Sex), mean, na.rm=TRUE))
    ```

6. Use a `formula` and the `aggregate()` function to describe the
   relationship between Year, Sex, and Weight

    ```{r brfss-aggregate-formula}
    aggregate(Weight ~ Year + Sex, brfss, mean)  # same, but more informative
    aggregate(. ~ Year + Sex, brfss, mean)       # all variables
    ```

7. Create a subset of the data consisting of only the 1990
   observations. Perform a t-test comparing the weight of males and
   females ("'Weight' as a function of 'Sex'", `Weight ~ Sex`)

    ```{r t-test-1990}
    brfss_1990 = brfss[brfss$Year == 1990,]
    t.test(Weight ~ Sex, brfss_1990)
    t.test(Weight ~ Sex, brfss, subset = Year == 1990)
    ```
   What about differences between weights of males (or females) in
   1990 versus 2010? Check out the help page `?t.test.formula`. Is
   there a way of performing a t-test on `brfss` without explicitly
   creating the object `brfss_1990`?

8. Use `boxplot()` to plot the weights of the Male individuals.
   Can you transform weight, e.g., `sqrt(Weight) ~ Year`?
   Interpret the results. Do similar boxplots for the t-tests of the
   previous question.

    ```{r brfss-boxplot, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
    boxplot(Weight ~ Year, brfss, subset = Sex == "Male",
            main="Males")
    ```

9. Use `hist()` to plot a histogram of weights of the 1990 Female individuals.

    ```{r brfss-hist, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
    hist(brfss_1990[brfss_1990$Sex == "Female", "Weight"],
         main="Females, 1990", xlab="Weight" )
    ```

### ggplot2


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

- http://docs.ggplot2.org

'Grammar of graphics'

- Specify data and 'aesthetics' (`aes()`) to be plotted
- Add layers (`geom_*()`) of information

Clean it by coercing `Year` to factor. A factor is a categorical variable. In this case, our data have only two years represented, so we will treat these two years as "groups" or categories.

```{r}
brfss$Year <- factor(brfss$Year)
```

Let's make a couple of subsets of data to work with. First, let's subset to get only males in 2010.

```{r males2010}
brfss2010Male = subset(brfss,Sex=='Male' & Year=='2010')
```

and make an "only female" subset.

```{r femalesOnly}
brfssFemale = subset(brfss,Sex=='Female')
```


    ```{r, warning=FALSE}
    ggplot(brfss2010Male, aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method="lm")
    ```
    
- Capture a plot and augment it

    ```{r, warning=FALSE}
    plt <- ggplot(brfss2010Male, aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method="lm")
    plt + labs(title = "2010 Male")
    ```
    
- Use `facet_*()` for layouts

    ```{r, warning=FALSE}
    ggplot(brfssFemale, aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
        geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") +
        facet_grid(. ~ Year)
    ```
        
- Choose display to emphasize relevant aspects of data

    ```{r, warning=FALSE}
    ggplot(brfssFemale, aes(Weight, fill=Year)) +
        geom_density(alpha=.2)
    ```


## ALL Phenotypic Data

This data comes from an (old) Acute Lymphoid Leukemia microarray data
set. The actual data are available at [THIS LINK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seandavi/ITR/master/ALL-phenoData.csv) or by downloading 
using R.

```{r}
download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seandavi/ITR/master/ALL-phenoData.csv',
              destfile = 'ALL-phenoData.csv')
```

Choose the file that contains ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
patient information and input the date using `read.csv()`; for
`read.csv()`, use `row.names=1` to indicate that the first column
contains row names.

```{r ALL-choose, eval=FALSE}
path <- file.choose()    # look for ALL-phenoData.csv
```

<!--
```{r echo=FALSE}
path <- "ALL-phenoData.csv"
```
-->

```{r ALL-input}
stopifnot(file.exists(path))
pdata <- read.csv(path, row.names=1)
```

Check out the help page `?read.delim` for input options. The exercises
use `?read.csv`; Can you guess why? Explore basic properties of the
object you've created, for instance...

```{r ALL-properties}
class(pdata)
colnames(pdata)
dim(pdata)
head(pdata)
summary(pdata$sex)
summary(pdata$cyto.normal)
```

Remind yourselves about various ways to subset and access columns of a
data.frame

```{r ALL-subset}
pdata[1:5, 3:4]
pdata[1:5, ]
head(pdata[, 3:5])
tail(pdata[, 3:5], 3)
head(pdata$age)
head(pdata$sex)
head(pdata[pdata$age > 21,])
```

It seems from below that there are 17 females over 40 in the data
set. However, some individuals have `NA` for the age and / or sex, and
these `NA` values propagate through some computations. Use `table()`
to summarize the number of females over 40, and the number of samples
for which this classification cannot be determined. When _R_
encounters an `NA` value in a subscript index, it introduces an `NA`
into the result. Observe this (rows of `NA` values introduced into the
result) when subsetting using `[` versus using the `subset()`
function.

```{r ALL-subset-NA}
idx <- pdata$sex == "F" & pdata$age > 40
table(idx, useNA="ifany")
dim(pdata[idx,])           # WARNING: 'NA' rows introduced
tail(pdata[idx,])
dim(subset(pdata, idx))    # BETTER: no NA rows
dim(subset(pdata, (sex == "F") & (age > 40)))  # alternative
tail(subset(pdata,idx))

## robust `[`: exclude NA values
dim(pdata[idx & !is.na(idx),])
```

Use the `mol.biol` column to subset the data to contain just
individuals with 'BCR/ABL' or 'NEG', e.g.,

```{r ALL-BCR/ABL-subset}
bcrabl <- subset(pdata, mol.biol %in% c("BCR/ABL", "NEG"))
```

The `mol.biol` column is a factor, and retains all levels even after
subsetting. It is sometimes convenient to retain factor levels, but in
our case we use `droplevels()` to removed unused levels

```{r ALL-BCR/ABL-drop-unused}
bcrabl$mol.biol <- droplevels(bcrabl$mol.biol)
```

The `BT` column is a factor describing B- and T-cell subtypes

```{r ALL-BT}
levels(bcrabl$BT)
```

How might one collapse B1, B2, ... to a single type B, and likewise
for T1, T2, ..., so there are only two subtypes, B and T? One strategy
is to replace two-letter level (e.g., `B1`) with the single-letter
level (e.g., `B`). Do this using `substring()` to select the first
letter of level, and update the previous levels with the new value
using `levels<-`.

```{r ALL-BT-recode}
table(bcrabl$BT)
levels(bcrabl$BT) <- substring(levels(bcrabl$BT), 1, 1)
table(bcrabl$BT)
```

Use `aggregate()` to count the number of samples with B- and T-cell
types in each of the BCR/ABL and NEG groups

```{r ALL-BCR/ABL-BT}
aggregate(rownames(bcrabl) ~ BT + mol.biol, bcrabl, length)
```

Use `aggregate()` to calculate the average age of males and females in
the BCR/ABL and NEG treatment groups.

```{r ALL-aggregate}
aggregate(age ~ mol.biol + sex, bcrabl, mean)
```

Use `t.test()` to compare the age of individuals in the BCR/ABL versus
NEG groups; visualize the results using `boxplot()`. In both cases,
use the `formula` interface. Consult the help page `?t.test` and re-do
the test assuming that variance of ages in the two groups is
identical. What parts of the test output change?

```{r ALL-age}
t.test(age ~ mol.biol, bcrabl)
boxplot(age ~ mol.biol, bcrabl)
```
