# Preface {-}


Presented here is a collection of materials meant to provide a self-directed set
of experiments and exercises to learn the basics of the R language for data science.
These materials are neither complete or comprehensive. Also, the order of topics makes
some logical sense, but they have not been designed as a single cohesive "curriculum".
As such, the various chapters may be treated somewhat independently.
